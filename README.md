# Automated-Molecular-Docking
The Automated Molecular Docking project automates the process of preparing protein and ligand structures for docking simulations. It fetches PDB and ligand files, processes them by adding hydrogens and charges, and runs docking simulations, predicting interactions to streamline drug discovery efforts efficiently.
